<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

                  This project utilizes a social media called Instagram and analyzes the data based on each individual's account.

Here's how:
* The user then runs the python program.
* The program prints out instructions for the user, it order to have the needed information.
* In a folder, the user should have three files downloaded from Instagram. Followers_1.html, Following.html, Pending_follow_request.html.
* The user gets prompted to enter their login credentials.
* The program then sorts out all of their followers, following, and pending follow requests.

Originially, we had planned on accessing the Instagram API and have those datas automatically be applied to the program with just the user needing to enter their login credentials, but unfortunately Instagram has guidelines that wouldn't allow developers to access that data without creating developer accounts and requesting access from the platform, which takes time to approve.
